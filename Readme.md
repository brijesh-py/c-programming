# C Programming Projects

Welcome to my repository for basic C programming projects! This repository contains a collection of simple projects aimed at helping beginners learn and practice C programming concepts. Feel free to explore the projects, try them out, and expand upon them as you continue to develop your skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one, you can download and install one such as GCC ([GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/)).

Once you have a C compiler set up, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brijesh-py/c-programming.git
```
